## 🌍 Vision – Safety Without Borders  
Emergencies don’t respect borders. Whether in **Lagos, New York, or Tokyo**, everyone deserves instant access to help.  

Inspired by:  
- **Google Maps** – precision location for life-saving directions  
- **Uber** – real-time, on-demand response model  
- **Crypto & Blockchain** – secure identity, payments & resilience  

We aim to collaborate with the **United Nations (UN)**, **World Health Organization (WHO)**, **Red Cross**, **Interpol**, and NGOs to make **safety a universal human right**.

## 🔑 Core Features  
- 🆘 **One-Tap SOS Alerts** – notify family, responders & authorities instantly  
- 📍 **Emergency Locator** – find nearest hospitals, police, fire stations & shelters  
- 🔴 **Live Scene Awareness** – trigger global map alerts with danger pings (even offline)  
- 🤖 **AI Crisis Guidance** – real-time first aid, fire safety & mental health support  
- 📡 **Offline Mode** – works even without internet connectivity  
- 🔗 **Decentralized Safety Network** – powered by blockchain & community trust

## ⭐ Groundbreaking Innovation: Live Scene – Trigger Awareness  

One of the **50 breakthrough features** that makes **ONLYEMERGENCY** stand out is the **Live Scene section**.  

With **Trigger Awareness alerts**, users can:  
- Select the **incident type** (e.g., robbery, accident, fire, disaster)  
- Instantly **notify the world & the right agencies** to act **fast and effectively**  
- Launch the **Google Global Map live scene board**, showing the user’s **current location** with a **danger ping** ⚠️  
- Stay protected **even offline** → the system continues **monitoring the victim’s movement until rescue arrives**  

✨ Our mission: **Safety Without Borders**

## ⚡ Trigger Awareness – On & Off Control  

🌍 **WA-EBS™ – The World’s First Accountable Emergency Broadcast System 💡**  
**WA-EBS™ – Global Trust. Local Action.**  

How it works:  
1. **Select Incident Type** → Choose robbery, accident, fire, disaster  
2. **Click Trigger Awareness** → Google Live Board opens with real-time tracking like a stock/crypto live feed  
3. **Global Visibility** → Location + danger ping sent to **all connected security agencies + global community feed**  
4. **Turning Off** →  
   - System asks for **reason form**  
   - **Face authentication** video ensures user is safe & not under duress  
   - If verified ✅ → system disconnects  
   - If not ❌ → danger ping remains active until agencies confirm safety  

✨ Accountability. Transparency. Trust.  
**Safety Without Borders** 🚨
